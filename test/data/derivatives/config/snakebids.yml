  bids_dir:
    help: The directory with the input dataset formatted according to the BIDS standard.
  output_dir:
    help: The directory where the output files should be stored. If you are running
      group level analysis, this folder should be prepopulated with the results of
      the participant level analysis.
  analysis_level:
    help: Level of the analysis that will be performed
    choices: *id001
  --participant_label:
    help: The label(s) of the participant(s) that should be analyzed. The label corresponds
      to sub-<participant_label> from the BIDS spec (so it does not include "sub-").
      If this parameter is not provided, all subjects will be analyzed. Multiple participants
      can be specified with a space seperated list.

  --exclude_participant_label:
    help: The label(s) of the participant(s) that should be excluded. The label corresponds
      to sub-<participant_label> from the BIDS spec (so it does not include "sub-").
      If this parameter is not provided, all subjects will be analyzed. Multiple participants
      can be specified with a space sepearated list.

  --freesurfer_dir:
    help: The path to the freesurfer directory. If not provided, workflow assumes
      the directory exists at <output_dir>/freesurfer.
  --responsemean_dir:
    help: Provide directory containing average response functions. If not provided,
      one will be computed from the subjects in the input directory.
  --shells:
    help: '(Mrtrix3) specify one or more b-values to use during processing, as a comma-separated
      list of the desired approximate b-values (b-values are clustered to allow for
      small deviations). Note that some commands are incompatible with multiple b-values,
      and will report an error if more than one b-value is provided. WARNING: note
      that, even though b=0 volumes are never referred to as shells in the literature,
      they still have to be explicitly included in the list of b-values as provided
      to the -shell option! Several algorithms which include the b=0 volumes in their
      computations may otherwise return an undesired reuslt.'
    nargs: +
  --lmax:
    help: (Mrtrix3) the maximum spherical harmonic order for the output FOD(s). For
      algorithms with multiple outputs, this should be provided as a comma-sperated
      list of integers, one for each output image; for single-output algorithms, only
      a single integer should be provided. If omitted, commands will use the lmax
      of the corresponding response function (i.e. based on its number of coefficients),
      up to a maximum of 8.
    nargs: +
  --step:
    help: '(Mrtrix3) set the step size of the algorithm in mm. Should set to 4 steps
      per voxel (e.g. 1/4 * voxel size) in order to sample more frequently in compact
      region. (default: 0.35mm)'

    help: '(Mrtrix3) set the desired number of streamlines to be selected, after all
      selection criteria has been applied (i.e. inclusion/exclusion ROIS, min/max
      length, etc. Streamlines will be seeded until this number of streamlines have
      been selected, or the maximum allowed number of seeds has been exceeded. Set
      to zero to disable, which will result in streamlines being seeded until the
      maximum allowed number of seeds has been reached. (default: 20,000,000 streamlines)'
    default: 20000000
  --radial_search:
    help: '(Mrtrix3) perform a radial search from each streamline endpoint to locate
      the nearest node. Argument is the maximum radius in mm; if no node is found
      within this radius, the streamline endpoint is not assigned to any node. (default:
      1.5mm)'
