SCATTR is a BIDS App that performs a tractography processing workflow to 
identify connections between targetted structures of interest (extracted from
various atlases) in the brain, using some common neuroimaging tools like 
`prepdwi`, `Freesurfer`, and `Mrtrix3`.

![Example outputs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/khanlab/scattr/main/docs/images/ex_output.png)

This is useful for:

* Analyzing structural connections of known brain circuits
* Examining specific connections of interest
* Comparison across different groups (e.g. controls vs patients)


## Example use of workflow 
This workflow was used to process and analyze the data from
[`hcp_subcortical_repo`](https://github.com/kaitj/hcp_subcortical_repro) 
(see Kai et al., 2022). 

## Workflow 
A brief summary of the workflow can be found below (see documentation for
a detailed summary):

_Note: The workflow assumes Freesurfer has already been run on the dataset, as 
well as diffusion preprocessing (e.g. distortion correction)._

![Workflow example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/khanlab/scattr/main/docs/images/workflow.png)

1. Merge the segmentations of structures in a standard template space from 
various sources (if necessary) via 
[labelmerge](https://zenodo.org/record/7636410) into a combined atlas, which is 
used downstream to identify targeted connections.
1. Estimate and apply transformations from standard template space to 
subject-specific space.
1. Further process the pre-processed diffusion data to enable tractography
(e.g. compute response functions, fibre orientation distribution, 
normalization).
1. Perform whole-brain tractography from computed files, applying filtering 
(e.g. SIFT2) to computed tractogram. Once filtered, connections between the 
merged segmentations (from step 1) are identified, generating a connectome map.
1. Analysis can then be performed on the map to examine and explore the 
connectome of interest.
